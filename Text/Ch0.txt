The continent of Wada...[NL]
To the southeast of Blitzia...[NL]
For 1,000 years it has stood [NL]
in peace, ever since the [NL]
Great Legendary Hero set off [NL]
to defeat the fearsome [NL]
Demon King Zephinard, [A]even though[NL]
no one has idea what happened[NL]
to him ever since he left.[NL]
No, don't ask me, damn it![NL]
I am not the hints corner![A][2NL]
[2NL]
In the kingdom of Aienaka,[NL]
King Ston and Queen Tendo,[NL]
witnessed the birth of their[NL]
child during a full moon.[A][NL]
After a long discussion[NL]
on names, they went with[NL]
their final choice.[NL]
Their name would be now:[NL]
[ToggleRed][Tact][ToggleRed]![A][2NL]
[2NL]
[Tact] would meet friends [NL]
in their childhood, as well [NL]
as help the citizens with [NL]
every issue present. [A][NL]
(Except their personal[NL]
gender issues.)[A][NL]
This way, [Tact] learned[NL]
that the level of royalty[NL]
doesn't matter when it[NL]
comes to aiding the innocent.[A][2NL]
[2NL]
However, during [NL]
[Tact]'s 15th [NL]
birthday, the Baein [NL]
Nation attacks.[A][NL]
Xemnas, one of the [NL]
royal knights,[NL]
is given the task to [NL]
train them, in order [NL]
to defend their home.[A][2NL]
[2NL]
Along their way, [NL]
[Tact] meets up[NL]
with other princes of [NL]
various kingdoms, [A][NL]
but the most recognizeable[NL]
faces to them are Feil, prince[NL]
of Lolster, Althea, princess of[NL]
Rev, and Kharan, prince [NL]
of Ephrae.[A][2NL]
[2NL]
During the war, [NL]
Feil has to[NL]
defend the borders of Wada, [NL]
giving [Tact] time [NL]
to train themselves.[A][NL]
One summer, [Tact] receives[NL]
a letter from Althea, [NL]
describing that there [NL]
would be a refreshing[NL]
festival at Castle Rev.[A][NL]
[2NL]
However, when [Tact] arrives[NL]
to the nearabouts, [NL]
they find something[NL]
other than a festival...[A][X]

# 0x903

Aha! This must be Rev Castle,
and lookie here! They made
a little festival. How rude of
King Roian not to invite
us. Boys, show 'em!

As you wish, boss!

# 0x904

Lord Roian... Bandits
have invaded the castle...!

These... these aren't
mere bandits!
These are... advanced
bandits!
They hold the banner
of the Kingdom of Baein!

Sir Holme.

Your orders?

Please, escort my daughter
to the stables.
Get her a pesgasus, and
have her find help.
If in doubt, smack any thugs
that get in your way.

Alright, my liege, but...
what will become of you?

I will be alright, as long
as I have Sir Roland, and
my Enchanted Sword,
the Teirfung.
Wherever it is.
...
Wheremst is my
blade?!

# 0x905

Sir. I have bad news.
The bandits have crafted
a clever ruse.
The blade was stolen
during the assault.

What?! How could this
happen? Where's my
boy at!?

Roland has started to give
chase to the bandits.
We're not sure how long
we'll be able to hold.

# 0x906

Who could help us...?
Ah! [Tact]!
I'm sure she received
my letter.
If I am correct... She should
be... over there!.

# 0x907

Ah, I wonder how today's
festival is going to be.

Hopefully nothing too
dumb. Last year had
a guy in a pink suit.

Right. What the hell
was up with that?
The man of the eggs
told good jokes, though.

Lady [Tact]!
Princess Althea is 
approaching.

Wait, how do you know?
Are you sure we're not
copying from FE1?

I have special eyes.
Please, don't break the
fourth wall, your highness.

[Tact], I need
your help!
Soldiers of Baein have
seized the castle!
My dad and the citizens
of Rev are in danger!
Please, help us!

Oh, I am sure they are
strong enough. The bandits
are down as we speak.

They have taken the
Legendary Weapon (TM).

Well, they got the
prepromote as well.

... They hurt a cat
in their way in, and
ate your chips.

WHAT?!
I can't let this
stand any longer...
I'll help you drive
these bandits away
and restore peace
to your home!
Come on, friends!
Let's advance!

As you say,
Lady [Tact]!
(Note to self: Don't
mess with cats.)

(Don't eat her chips
either.)
I'm ready for the
battle. Are you,
Chen?

Yes. I got you 
covered, just in case.
It's my first time.

(Was that a double
entendre?)

Ugh, I can't believe
I couldn't sneak away.
It worked always, but
why not now?!

John, stop complaining. Our
majesty's word is command.
Now come on.

Agh... why me?!

# 0x908

What the... What do ye' 
mean the girl is gone?!

W-Well... I almost
had her, and-

Zero excuses, you dirty
coward! Go, go, go!
The Emperor of Baein
won't forgive slackers!

# 0x909

Oh, this could be destiny!
I have been brought into
the arms of a beauty!

I... er... thanks?
Who are you?

My name is Vojtir, and I am
a on a mission. Allow me to heal
all of your wounds.

Wait!
Why was he staring away
from my face when he saw me?

# 0x90A

Ah, Baein has started the
war, I see? Well, thanks
for the warning. However,
it seems that you need help.
I am Vojtir, a pastor of
the Church of Circles.
Allow me to heal the wounds
of your party.

# 0x90B
Heh, war sure has
lit up. Perf' time
t'steal 'n 'sack!

Hang in 'ere! I
gotta tie m'shoes.

Aye. I'll go 'head.
'Member to steal th'
stuff o' th' soldiers!

# 0x90C
Huh? Wait, what?
It's been 7 turns already?
Everyone, onto
the enemy! We must
protect the slob in the lead!

# 0x90D
Well, that was something.
He had no chance of
dunking me, anyways.

Stay right where you
are, vandals! Here I
come--

A-Ah! L-Lady [Tact]!
You've defeated them!
For a moment, I thought
I had seen one of them.

You might want to check
your sight, majesty.
Only quality thugs have
overly muscular faces.

I guess you're right...
You guys are too pretty for--
Oh right, how did you get here?

I... got the letter from
your daughter.

Ah, where is she?

Father!

Ack...! My little
Althea... I was so
worried... ... ...
Okay, that's starting
to hurt. My bones. Ow.

Ah, sorry. I am just
glad that you're safe.
Have you seen Master
Roland?

Well, he's left to chase
after the vandals. I'm
sure he'll kick their asses.

Ah...

Don't worry. [Tact] here will
take care of you. You may even
find Master Roland on the way,
I guess.

Okay, now I get to babysit a
girl full of potential.

Blame Kaito Shibano.

I... wasn't talking about 
the fanservice.

Oh.

Might as well give you some 
nifty gold, because we spent
most of it in the festival.

I'd accept, but as you can see,
I am a sucker for--

... And some cheese-flavored
potato chips.

!!

# 0x90E

Thank you kindly,
King Roian. I shall move
on to stop Baein. Say,
do you have any ships?

I'd love to help, but we...
don't even have a port. 
I didn't want to plagiarize FE1.

Well, that's bad... At least
you chose the honest way.
Quantity over quality.

It's [ToggleRed]Quanity[ToggleRed], [Tact].

Oh, okay.
Thank you either way, my old
man.

Ha ha ha... (Why are hugs so
effective against me?!)

# 0x90F

So, are you coming?
Are you sure that you agree
to being deadweight?

I don't like the way
you worded it, but sure! 
I'd do anything to find
Master Roland!

Even if it means I get a bad
ending just for your death?

I am not Caeda, am I?

Pfft. Oh, yes. Daddy told me
to give you this as well.

A Reginleif? Nice! You can't
have enough lord weapons!

Of course not.
I wish IntSys stopped locking
Rapiers to the lords. It's
getting really old, honestly.

I... wish they actually bring
back axe lords, but hey:
"Maeda is the future".

Oh, silly girl. Wada is the
master race. Anyway, let's
march ahead... or something.
